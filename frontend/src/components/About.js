        This project is a proof of concept based idea of utilizing facial
        recognition and computer vision to handle board game reservations and
        returns in a small club, that being a student group in this instance.
        This was done as a school project and the idea for the subject came from
        one of the students on the team, suggesting that we could do something
        using facial recognition and computer vision. The whole team agreed, and
        with no particular product or end goal in mind, this is what we came up
        with.
